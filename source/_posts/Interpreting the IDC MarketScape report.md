After two years, IDC has once again released its IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Assessment of Public Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service Providers report, in which Akamai is recognized as a contender (pictured). In this report, IDC evaluated 13 cloud providers that offer services in all regions of the world and generate more than $100 million in Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) revenue in 2021.

Akamai's inclusion in this first IDC MarketScape report in two years for global public cloud IaaS demonstrates the strength of Akamai's cloud services, which are built on Akamai's Edge Computing Network, one of the largest distributed networks in the world.

## Passionate user base

In its provider profile on Akamai, IDC MarketScape states, "In February, content delivery network (CDN) provider Akamai announced plans to acquire Linode for $900 million, immediately becoming a prominent new force in the public cloud IaaS space." The report also acknowledges that "if there's one thing Akamai has, it's a passionate user base. At the time of the acquisition, Linode had more than 150,000 active customers."

The report goes on to note that Akamai "now offers a wide range of open source compute, storage, networking, database and other middle-tier software and development tools. This lineup can be combined with Akamai's CDN, serverless and Web security services."

## Poised for Further Success

IDC MarketScape also noted, "By the end of 2023, Akamai will add new Linode data centers in North America, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. This expansion complements and integrates with Akamai's globally distributed network, which currently consists of 4,200 points of presence in 135 countries around the world."

Looking ahead, the report states, "The combination of Akamai and Linode should now be able to meet the needs of a broader audience for cloud computing by offering a broad portfolio of cloud, CDN and security products. In a world where business models in many industries depend on the reliable delivery of rich content, Akamai appears poised for even greater success with IaaS."

> "Spending on public cloud IaaS has also seen significant growth, increasing 35.6% to $91.3 billion by 2021."

## COVID-19 How to drive cloud growth

Since the release of the last IDC MarketScape based on public cloud IaaS in 2020, IDC has observed significant changes in the cloud marketplace as hyperscalers and new players such as Akamai are expanding their services into new areas around the world.

While IDC recognizes that changing business realities during the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a partial migration to public cloud IaaS, the report also concludes that there are "better, richer choices, thanks to strategic decisions made by providers." Some of those changes include:

+ Innovative partnerships between local software providers and public cloud IaaS providers.
+ Single-focused cloud providers entering areas such as adding compute to storage
+ Large independent software providers moving operations to the public cloud and catering to customers who want their applications and data to run close to home for privacy and regulatory reasons.
+ Multi-cloud continues to evolve as the preferred deployment model for customers due to service selection and provider management, etc.

Spending on public cloud IaaS also shows significant growth, growing 35.6% to $91.3 billion in 2021 IDC's analysts do not see a reversal of the trend: "In fact, IDC's estimates show that spending on public cloud IaaS will exceed spending on traditional infrastructure and private clouds combined over the next several years. "

## Key Takeaways

The latest IDC MarketScape also highlights some key takeaways, including how to build a cloud strategy that drives innovation, cost savings and effectiveness:

+ Freedom for developers from restrictive rules set by a single cloud provider.
+ Allow organizations to compare prices and find the right fit for their budgets
+ Matching the right workloads to the right cloud

## Finding the right cloud for the right workloads

IDC MarketScape acknowledges that there will always be some traditional on-site infrastructure use cases for some businesses, "such as older, stable custom applications."

Yes, other common issues that tie companies to on-site databases, including latency and security, can be addressed by Akamai, which supports and protects online businesses.The opportunity that Akamai has seized in this modern era of public cloud IaaS is to match specific workloads to specific clouds.

## Locating Workloads

As IDC MarketScape notes, "It's critical to locate workloads not only by cost, but also by factors such as service adjacency, the provider's broader ecosystem, and the provider's commitment to interoperability and open standards."
